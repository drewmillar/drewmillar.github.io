<h2>My Resume</h2>
<p>
Here is the resume of Drew Millar.
</p><p>
In between each paragraph, just use those close and open p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
</p><p>
You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
Just write inside an HTML file directly!
So much simpler.
</p><p>
You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
Or insert an image like this:
</p><p>
<img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">
</p><p>
That's it!
